## Overview
C squared is a general-purpose, low-level pragmatic programming language designed specifically to be as explicit as possible.

C squared prioritizes comfort and reliability over 
- Preference of specific groups of programmers.
- Terseness of code.
- Abstract concepts (even if they might favor the language's range of use cases).

C squared also aims to be completely at the user's control, with:
- Configuration of the compiler's behavior (file output, flags, log level, *strictness* [which, for example, mandates if the compiler should treat warnings as errors too], etc.).
- Removable modules (allowing for the removal of standard library in the program or certain parts of it to make programs more lightweight).

## Programs
Programs in C squared consist of **one or more** declaration(s).

Programs MUST include the `main` function **only once**.

Programs CAN declare (aside from the `main` function):
- Other [functions]().
- File [scope]() variables.
- [Structures]().
- [Enumeration]().
