# Overview
C&sup2; is an enhanced version of [C lang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_\(programming_language), made to:
- Be easier.
- Be more flexible.
- Include more features for convenience.
- Include more complex structures and types overall.
- Give better error reports and help overall.
- And, most importantly, **make low-level simpler**.


## What this book IS *NOT*
This book is the **specification** of C&sup2;. It contains all information about the behavior and definitions of C&sup2;. This book is **NOT** a manual or documentation for C&sup2;, it supposes the user already has background knowledge of C&sup2;.

If C&sup2; declares a magic singleton, you will find it here; if it contains a primitive built-in type, you will find it here.

You can't learn about C&sup2; by *just* reading this book. It does not contain informative paragraphs destinated to teaching, but objective information purely dedicated to showcasing how the language works internally.

## How and when to read this book
There are two main reasons why you would read this book:
- **Answer a specific question**: search for the answer by pressing `s`, and see if it can be solved.
- **Learn about the language's internals**: use the table of contents in the left.
